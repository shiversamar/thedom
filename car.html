<!-- Story 1:

Add (model) year, and a method that returns make, model and year as one String and use the method to tell the user.
Story 2:

Constrain the maximum speed to not exceed 85. Try taking it above 80 and see what happens.
Story 3:

Use a while loop to take speed up to 70, then use a while loop to brake down to 0. Surprise: it doesn't stop at 0, fix that.
Story 4:

Sometimes roads are slippery and downhill, and sometimes brakes fail: make the brake change the speed with a random amount with a maximum of plus or minus of the current speed. (Hint: try Math.random();)
